			This assessment is based on Dr. John Holland’s theory* that people and work environments can be loosely classified into six different groups: 
			<div class="pure-g">
				<div class="pure-u-8-24">- REALISTIC<br>- SOCIAL</div>
				<div class="pure-u-8-24">- INVESTIGATIVE<br>- ENTERPRISING</div>
				<div class="pure-u-8-24">- ARTISTIC<br>- CONVENTIONAL</div>
			</div>
			 <br>Different peoples’ personalities may find different environments more to their liking. <strong>While you may have some interests in and similarities to several of the six groups, you may be attracted primarily to two or three of the areas.</strong> These two or three letters are your <strong><em>Holland Code</em></strong>.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, with a code of “RES” you would most resemble the Realistic type, somewhat less resemble the Enterprising type, and resemble the Social type even less.</p>
			<p><em>note: </em>All types have both positive and negative qualities and none are better than the others. The Holland Code is a generalization, and not likely to be an exact fit. This condensed survey is not intended to be as accurate or comprehensive as a full psychometric instrument. Once completed, you will have an <span style="color:#0078e7">interest profile</span> to match to different career areas.</p>
